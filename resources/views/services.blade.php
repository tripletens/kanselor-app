                    <p class="services-text-card-text">
                    Our Company has an Institute of Pestology, which deals with the scientific study of pests, especially harmful insects and animals. 
                    This is a 70% practical and 30% theory training.  </br>
                    The Institute was established in year 2010, and has been able to train well over 1,300 Environmental Health Officers in conjunction with Environmental Health Officers Registration Council of Nigeria (EHORECON) during thematic trainings organized by the Council amongst other trainings by the Institute.
                    <br/>
                    We are prepared to open a window to non-professionals who  are providing services as regard Pest Control/Fumigation because of their deficiencies in the area of mixing, equipment selection and application.
                    Training of attendants and spray men are also carried out in the areas of health, safety and maintenance of equipment.
                    Training and re-training is a continuous exercise in our organization, establishing and enhancing especially those who intend to establish their own business.

                    Solid Waste can be defined as unwanted, or any discarded materials arising from human activities, which are not free flowing. <br/>
                    We need to ensure that Public Health is protected, promoted, diseases prevented, and prolongation of life achieved. Waste management is highly technical and need to be re-defined.<br/>
                    Consequently our motive is not only to collect and dispose off refuse but to enlighten the public that there is nothing call waste as what is termed  as waste is either re-cycle able, re-use able, and ………………  
                    Our Company is planning a pilot scheme, where sorting of refuse will start from home through coded liners or bags.

                    Environmental Assessment involves determining any changes or impact that a project or action will have on our Environment be it positive or negative before the project is carried out in order to prevent irrevocable damage from occurring.

                        Nosocromial diseases are rampant in the Hospital/Health Care facility environs due to non-challant attitude towards bio-medical waste.
                        Bio-medical waste may be solid or liquid. Example of infectious waste includes sharps, unwanted microbiological cultures and stocks, discarded blood, human or animal tissue, used bandages and dressings, used gloves, body fluids etc. Expert arrangement is desirable on separation of all these special waste/medical waste.
                        <br/>
                        Bio-medical waste is distinct from normal trash, is also differ from other types of hazardous waste.
                        We are zealously concern about its management which includes generation, accumulation, handling, storage, treatment, transport and disposal.

                    Everyone loves a beautiful place, laced with trees and flowers, with some flowers serving as repellents to insects and dangerous crawling animals.

                    Restoration of offices/homes by remover of tough stains, odor, allergens and maintenance of air quality is of utmost importance. 
                    <br/>
                    Ordinarily placement of garbage in an in-sanitary manner can lead to offensive odor, flies and rodent infestation, ants get attracted with droppings of food remnants etc.
                    Importance of usage of liners cannot be over emphasized, it prevents diseases attributable to waste matters.
                    When you make clean, you make healthy, when you make healthy, you prolong life.

                    In general, the most effective Vector Control Project has resulted from a combination of Environmental, Physical, Biological, and Chemical methods rather than from the use of insecticides alone.
                    We have been able to excel in the disinfestations of all this ‘unwanted guests’ such as roaches, especially (germanical), rodents, scorpion, bats, termites, wood borer, snakes, bees, wasps, bugs etc through the combination of the methods stated above.
                    It is not usage of chemicals alone, chemical control supplements, but does not supplant other insect control programs.

                        Drains means underground channel carrying out waste water out of a building. Drains may be artificial or natural the bottom line is the effectiveness in carrying out the water to the sea.<br/>
                        Defective construction of drains not properly supervised will result to ill-gradient and instead of free flow will become cesspits, thereby breeding larva of mosquitoes, hence the need for re-construction bearing in mind the topography of the area in question. Majority of drains in our cities and towns are not performing their functions, which have resulted in floods, collapse of buildings, wall fence, and even deaths.
                        Consequently, we on our path resulted to real channelisation of blocked/silted, ill-gradient, to ensure water flow. When there is good water management, breeding places will be nil, collapse of building will seize to be a daily affair, and diseases will be nipped in the bud.
